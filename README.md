<h1 align="center">Project: Electric Vehicle Population Data</h1>

---

<h2 align="center">Description</h2>

<p><strong>Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data</strong> is a project that explores the growth and distribution of electric vehicles across different regions. Data was collected from various sources to provide a comprehensive view of current and future trends in electric vehicle usage. The information was modeled in Power BI to create interactive visualizations that showcase the evolution of the electric vehicle population and its potential impacts on infrastructure and sustainability.</p>

<h2 align="center">Key Insights and Visualizations</h2>

<p>Some of the key findings include a significant increase in EV registrations over the last five years, with metropolitan areas showing the highest growth rates. The visualizations include interactive maps, growth charts, and comparative graphs that illustrate these trends effectively.</p>

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Solutions</h2>

<p>Some challenges encountered were incomplete data sets and discrepancies between different sources. These were addressed by cross-referencing data and applying transformation techniques to harmonize the information.</p>

<h2 align="center">Technologies Used</h2>

<ul align="center">
    <li>Power BI for data modeling and visualization.</li>
    <li>Excel for initial data cleaning and organization.</li>
    <li>APIs and web scraping tools for data extraction from online sources.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Conclusions and Recommendations</h2>

<p>The analysis indicates a rapid growth in electric vehicle adoption, suggesting the need for enhanced infrastructure, such as charging stations, in high-growth areas. Future analysis could focus on predicting the market demand for EV-related services and infrastructure improvements.</p>

<h2 align="center">Version Control and Documentation</h2>

<p>All changes and updates were managed using Git, ensuring proper version control and documentation of every step taken during the project.</p>
